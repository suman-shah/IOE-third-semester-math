# IOE-third-semester-math
IOE Engineering mathematics third semester (B.E.) very important and easy in overall mathematics of III semester. The main aim to prepare for 32 marks conform.
Cayley Hamilton: every square matrix over a commutative ring (such as the real or complex field
# For verification[5 mark]
	Let given matrix be A
	The characteristic equation is | A-"" I |=0
	Expand the matrix you will get (^3+^2+2" " +2I)=0; →A
	By using cayle Hamilton theorem A^3+A^2+2A+22I=0
	find A^3  and A^2and put in above equation and obtain RHS=0
#For A^(-1)
	Multiply the expression (A^3+A^2+2A+22I) by A^(-1) 
	and write A^(-1)=(remaining expression) & solve it you will get A^(-1)
#Eigen Vector and Eigen value[5 mark]
	Let given matrix be A
	The characteristic equation is | A-"" I |=0
 expand and keep in factor to get value of  =1,2,3(factorial form) =1,2,3 are eigen values 
	Let x=(x_1  x_2  x_3 ) be the Eigen vector corresponding to Eigen value 
	the characteristic matrix is (A-I)X=0
	Obtain the equations: (This is homogenous equation so for non trivalent solution (A-"" I)=0 which is characteristic equation so value of ""  must satisfy above equations.)
	find the value of x_1  x_2  x_3   for when =1
	find the value of x_1  x_2  x_3   for when =2
	find the value of x_1  x_2  x_3   for when =3
for every value of x_1  x_2  x_3  and    is eigen vector so multiple of this vector is also eigen vector so 
a_1 (x_1  x_2  x_3 )   a_1 !=0 is also eigen values.
Arrange column by column values of Eigen vector to get C-vector which is model matrix and for diagninization find〖  C〗^(-1) AC.

	!=0 gives the order of rank (i.e. rank of matrix)
#Rank by triangular and echelon form[5 mark]
	make a_11into 1 by row /column operation.
	make reaming element below a_11 into zero with a_11 by row operation.
	make a_22  =1
	and make below element zero by a_22  & repeat same process (when element below diagonal is zero than it is upper triangular & number of row element different than 
it is echelon form.) 

#Rank of matrix by normal and canonical form[5 mark]
	make a_11  →1 by row/column operation
	make a_11  below element zero by row operation
	make a_11 after element i.e. row elements(R1) zero by column operation.
	make a_22  =1 & by the help of this element make below element zero by row operation
	make R2 element after a_22 zero by column operation..
(repeat same process  until reached to [I] matrix I_r→r=rank of marix

#Test of Consistency[5 mark]
[A:B]→ Reduce it in upper triangular and echelon form by only row operation
#Procedure of simplex method[10 mark]
	select the column with highest positive value 
	If the highest positive value is repeated than select anyone.
	To determine which variable will be replaced divide the value in the Po column by corresponding coefficient in the optimum column i.e. Q_o=P_o/x_o1 
	select the row with the smallest positive ratio 
	If the smallest ratio is repeated choose anyone.
	Computation of value for the replacing (new) row.
